firewall:
	a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing nw traffic based on predetermined security rules

	active entity
	like IPS(intrusion prevention system)
	
types:
	packet filtering
		rules on IP packets
		source ip, dest ip, protocol and ports
		action based on rule(in filter table) otherwise default action
		at transport layer
		simple but less secure

	application level gateway
		aka proxy server
		more secure than packet filter
		at application level
		overhead is disadv
		application gateway is service specific such as TELNET, FTP, SMTP, HTTP

	circuit level gateway
		2 TCP connection:
			internal host to gateway
			external host to gateway
		security checkd done before setup
		after setup all data is passed
		faster than app lvl 

capability of firewall:
	single choke point to keep unauthorised user out
	prohibits vulnerable attacks-. both in and out
	protection from IP spoofing
	audits and alarms can be implemented on it

limitation
	can't protect from attack that bypass it
	can't protect from internal threats
	can't protect over tunneling over most app protocols: virus infected program


Network Address Translation (NAT) allows a private network to use a set of private addresses and a set of global Internet Addresses for external communication. It uses a translation table to route messages between the two networks and provides substantial security.

same IP address in diff private network thus prolonged life expectancy
