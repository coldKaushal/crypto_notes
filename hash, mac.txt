hash:
	varaible size ip -> fixed size op
	anybit change-> whole fn change
	one way function
	h = H(x)
	h= hash value, x= preimage of h

hmac:
	hash+ key = mac
	key lo, size dekho, size <k then pad, >k then pass thru hash to get a k sized k
	firr key XOR ipad, append to msg pass thru hash = h1
	firr key XOR opad, append to h1 then pass thru hash = h2
	pros:
		faster
		when public key not allowed
		produce smaller signs
	cons:
		key is issue
		not suited when receivers are many

mac based on block cipher:
	DAA= data auth algo
		cbc mode of des

	cmac:
		cipher based mac
		aes, triple des
