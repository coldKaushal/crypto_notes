intrusion detection system:
	passive mnitoring device
	detects potential threats and generates alarms
	no actual protection to endpoint or network

	types:
	NIDS:
		network based IDS
		monitor entire protected network
		visibilty to all traffic flowing
		decision based on packet metadata and content
		detect widespread threat because of more visibilty
		no visibilty into internals on endpoint

	HIDS
		host based IDS
		for particular endpoints
		against internal and external threats
		monitor nw traffic to and fro from system only
		limited visibilty => less context for decision making
		deep visibilty into host internals

	detection methods
		signature detection:
		fingerprint of know threats are used
		if someone is detected malicious acc to list then its contents are detected. therefore no false positives
		based on know malicious
		blind to zero day vulnerability

	anamoly detection:
		generate threats based on the behavious of normal model
		can detect zero-day threats
		building a normal model is tough as it need to balance fp and fn

	hybrid detction:
		comb of both
		low error than both

comb of IDS and IPS is better
