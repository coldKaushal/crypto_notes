CIA -> confidentiality , integrity , availability 
threat (potentail of voilation of securiy )  
attack ( delibrate attemp to breach security )

OSI MODEL ->
	security attack -> actions that compromises security
		passive : learn and make use of info , no change in info , still attacker get many info from location , frequcny etc about type of data being send , hard to detect 
			release of msg contents : try to read messages eaavesdropping (secreatly listening to messages)
			traffic analysis : loactiton , host , frequency of data sent , length of data sent .

		active : modification of data stream or insertion of new data streeams . hard to prevent

			masquarade : steals someones crediantials to act like the host itself.
			replay : capture info and send it again and again 
			modification of messages : 
			denial of services : overloading server , and server unable to repond to the one who need it. 

	security services -> enhance the security /protection , provide services.
		data confidentilty :
		data integrity :
		authentication : proves the identity of the claim , gmail login OTP
		access control : who can access what 
		nonrepudiation : proof that msg was sent by transmiiting party and proof that msg was recived by recieving party.	(u can't deny it once you are done sending or recieving)

	security mechanisms -> detect , prevent and recover from security attack
		data integrity :
		authentication exchange : entities some msg to each other to prove their identity 

		encipherment :
		access control :
		
		digital signature : prove the identity of sender
		traffic pading : introduce dummy data stream when both entities are idle.
		
		routing control : 
		notarization : trusted third party is used to control communication bt the two entities  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cryptography -> defination , block diagram etc 

cryptanalsis -> trying to decode the cipher text by attack , they try to find key based on some patterns , observation etc or use his previos knowledge to detect relationships etc 

bruteforce attack  -> trying all posible cmbination , can be prevneted using captcha etc to slow down process . 

classical encipherment techniques:
substitution 
	ceaser ( 3 shift)
	monoalphabtic (one to one mapping)
	playfair (put in the table and then vo 3 rules , pahle duplicates me filler add karne hai) 
	hill ( mtarix multipication and uske baad inverse nikalna hai , MMI ka use hoga , k^-1 ko pahle hi simplify karlio)
	polyalbhabet (key ko repeat kar dete to size of plain text , one to many mapping )
	one time pad (for every msg we have a unique key)

transposition 
    keyless , keypad ||||  
    railfence (diagonal me likh do  and then read)
    columnar (rowwise likhdo and then accorgding to key column wise karo)
    doulble (multiple time karo same cheez)

Modern encipeherment techiques :

 stream cipher and block cipher 

block cipher
	both are symetric key encryption technique
	DES
 		fiestel cipher 
   		64 -> 56 -> 48 size key
   		fiestel rounds 16 
   		swapping 
   		inside the function -> 32 bit data -> expansion box -> 48 xor 48 bit key -> sbox -> 32 bit 

   	~meet me behind the mall~

   	meet in the middle attack
   	double DES , triple DES


   	AES
   		plaint text is of 128 bits
   		state is in form of matrix [4 words 128 bits ]

   		intital key = 128 ie 4 words -> 44 words are gernated for sebsequent rnds
   	
   		substitution (subbyte transformation)
   		shift row 
   		columnar transformation
   		mix column 
   		add round key

   		intital round contains only add round key (ie xor operation )

   		last round doesn't contain mixing column

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BLOCK CIPHER MODE OF OPERATION NAHI KAR RAHA , CBC YAAD HAI BAS 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
just a quick recap :

RSA 
deffie hellman key exchnage , meet in the middle attack 

MMI nikala dekhliya  (1001)(s1-qs2)
fermet dekhle 

--------------------------------------------->
hash function :
	fixed length hash value (msg digest) for variable size input 
	hash given integrity


	characterstics :
	small chnage in input change hash by a lot 
	pre image resistant (one way)
	weak collision resistant 
	strong collision resistant 

	how hashes are made ? 
		one way is to divide in blocks of size of hash value and do xor operation to each bit of every block

		we can improve my making left shifts after xoring with a block 

		rest we have SHA , MD5

	applications : can provide authentication / confidentiality

	using symmetric key encryption :
		4 ways 
		 -  E(m + h(m)) -> confidentiality
		 -  m + E(h(m)) -> no confidentiality
		 -  m + h(m+ key) -> no confidentiality
		 -  E[m + h(m+ key)] -> confidentiality

	asymetric key -> provides authenticattion , user apni private key se emcrypt karega 
	decrypt karne vala iski public key se karega , msg milgya to matlab user ne bheja hai
		2 ways 
		 - m + PR(h(m))  => no confidentiality , but authentication
		 - E( m + PR(h(m)) ) => confidentiality  amd authentication = DIGITAL SIGNATURE (integrity to pahle se hi thi bcz hash use hua hai)

	other application : login ke time use hota hai , hash value match hoti h

	ex MD5 , SHA
--------------------------------------------->
sha dehkte hai baad me 

	bye bye nahi dekh raha , ganda hai , pahle 2 step yad hai lol

	input is less the 1<<128 and output is 512 bits 
	padding 10000000.....
	append length , add 128 bits and make expanded msg multiple of 1024
	initilise hash buffer and we say goodbye 
--------------------------------------------->
MAC 
	provide intigrety and authentication 
	fixed length mac output 
	also called cryptographic checksum
	MAC = C(K, M)

	3 ways 
	 - m + C(k , m) -> authentication
	 - E[m + C(k , m)] -> authentication + confidentiality  ( tied to plain text)
	 - E(m) + C(k , E(m)) -> authentication + confidentiality  ( tied to cipher text)

	differnce btw hash and mac 


 MAC based on hash [HMAC] : 

  [block diagram]
	msg -> hash -> msg digest -> encrypt -> output 

  7 steps  ->
  	make K+ of length b
  	XOR it with ipad [36] to give Si
  	append msg to Si   [Si + msg]
  	pass through hash (MD5  ,SHA) to get output H
  	XOR it with opad [5c] to give So
  	append H to So   [So + H]
  	pass through hash (MD5  ,SHA) to get final HMAC

 MAC based on cipher mode :
	DAA (data authentication algo)
		works on CBC mode (jisme chaining hoti h)
		use DES for encryption
		
		[D1 -> DES -> O1 bits]----->	 
		[D2 XOR O1  -> DES -> O2]----> and so one 

		equation likh dena 

	CMAC :
		use AES and triple DES
  		divided into blocks (like AES 128 , DES 64)

		[M1 -> E[K , Mi] -> O1 block]----->	 
		[M2 XOR O1  -> E[K , Mi] -> O2]----> and so one 
		--last me ---
		[Mn XOR On XOR K'  -> E[K , Mi] -> On]----> MSB bits bcz MAC is of specific no of bits

		equation likh dena 
--------------------------------------------------->
Key distribution/mangement dekhte hai baad me and digital signature bhi (vaise uska ek block diagram already pata hai )
	ye dikhne me to kerberoses walle steps hi hia , ke appas me verigy karo appni apni keys deke

	The main aim of key management is to generate a secret key between two parties and store it toprove the authenticity between communicating users.
    Key management is the techniques which support key generation, storage and maintenance ofthe key between authorized users.
	
    key distribution :
    	symmetric / private key distribution
    		symmetric 
    		asymetric
    	assymmetric / public key distribution
    		public announcememnt of public keys 
    		directory 
    		public key authority
    		public key certificates 

    master key , sessoin key 
 1.a
    A asks KDC to communicate with B
    KDC provide an emcrytp key , halp of which A can decode 
    A sends the rest of msg to B 
    B decypt rrest of msg (matlab inka kuch authentication ka chal raha hai )
    then they send a nonce and send btw A and B 
    now they are authenticated , hece they can comminicate now
 

 	KDC me heirarchy ho skte hai  
 	session key life time 	


 	decentralised key (no use of KDC )
 	do apas me hi settle kar lete hai 
 	session key excahnged wothout KDC
  
  1.b
  	one uses public key of other , and vo dursa apni private se authenticate kar lega 

  2a. broadcast his public key  ( no authentication , anyone can pretend to be any user )
   b. trusted entity maintain a directoy of pubic keys (vahi KDC wala RR)
   c. use certificate generated by CA 
   d.

KERBEROS ( 3 head dog m guardian of the entrance)

	- authentication  (of user who want to use service )
	- authorisation  ( KDC (key distribution center) )
	- acounting ( services )


	requirement  -> it should be
	- reliable 
	- secure 
	- scalable

	KDC -> AS + TGC
	authenication server (AS) -> its a database where all the users id and passwords are saved and check it user is authorised or not.
	ticket granting server TGC  -> A server that issues tickets for desired services . 
	
	ticket -> Created once the AS accepts the user as authentic; contains the userâ€™s ID and	network address and the serverâ€™s ID

	SIMPLE AUTHENTICATION DIALOGUE :
		3 steps  
		- user asks AS for ticket to access a service by giviing its identity annd address of service 
			C-> AS [IDuser , passworduser , IDservice]
		- AS gives a encrypted ticket which only the service can decrypt 
			AS -> C [ E(k ,IDuser , IDservice , etc )  ](ticket)
		- user take this ticket to service , it verifies if it is authorized user  and grant access to service 
			C-> V   [IDuser , ticket]
	
	MORE SECURE AUTHENTICATION DIALOGUE :
		5 steps
		- user asks AS for communication with TGS for ticket to access a service by giviing its identity annd and of TGT
			C-> AS [IDuser , IDtgt]
		- AS gives a encrypted ticket which only the TGT can decrypt 
			AS -> C [ E(k ,IDuser , IDtgt , lifetime , etc )  ](ticket)
		- user take this ticket to TGT ,  
			C-> TGT  [IDuser ,IDservice , ticket]
		- TGT verifies if it is authorized user  and a ticket is grante a ticket  for accessing service 
			TGT -> C [ E(k ,IDuser , IDservice , lifetime , etc ) ]
		- user take this ticket to service , it verifies if it is authorized user  and grant access to service 
			C-> V   [IDuser , ticket]

X509 certificate  : its kind of a license / idcard whose main aim is to provide authentication of resorrces over internet . it is based on cryptography(RSA) and digital signature 	

 it has  ->
	- version 
	- serial no
	- algo used to sign certificate

	- validity period 

	- identity of the issuer ( certificate authority )
	- verify id of the issuer ( certificate authority )

	- identity of the owner 
	- verify id of the owner 
	
	- users public key info and the algo used to generater it 

	- digital signature  (hash code of above things)

	- extension (others)

 revocation of certifcate 
	- maybe its expired validity
	- user chnges its private key for some reason 
	- no longer verified 

	think of credit card (what you give to get one (identity , identity of previous certificate(signature)  , new dates , etc))
--------------------------------------------------->
PRIX dekhte hai baad me 
(Public-key infrastructure (PKI) as the set of hardware, software, people, policies, and procedures needed to
create, manage, store, distribute, and revoke digital certificates based on asymmetric cryptography.)

baaki uske kuch elemnts hote hai 
End entity , Certification authority (CA)  , Registration authority (RA) , CRL issuer , Repository

PGP  (pretty good service) [JAVATPOINT]
	
	- provides email security
	- uses digital signature to provide all the things (privacy, integrity, authentication, non repudation)
	- uses several combunation of hashing , data compression , symmetic and assym encrytion and various algo at each step
	- email compactaboly using RADIX-64 security scheme 
	- convert the email into NVT 7 bit ascii format.

	[basic block diagram ]
		email ---[SHA]---> hash code ---[RSA]---> digital signature -> zip code -> aaa aage gada sa hai (symetric key encryption ) + key ka assymmtric encryption + concatinatie karke 
		digital signatures banke bhej do 
--------------------------------------------------->
S/MIME	Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions [JAVATPOINT]
	
	pahle PGP ki limitations likh dena 
		help non acsii data to send through the emails (eg digital content , pictures ,video , audio )
		differnet languages like french and german which cannt be represented in acsii can also be sent 
	uses SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol) 
	aymmetric key encrypion 
	uses digital signature to provide all the things (privacy, integrity, authentication, non repudation)

	MIME headers -> 
	1. MIME Version
	It defines the version of the MIME protocol. This header usually has a parameter value 1.0, indicating that the message is formatted using MIME.

	2. Content Type
	It describes the type and subtype of information to be sent in the message. These messages can be of many types such as Text, Image, Audio, Video, and they also have many subtypes such
	 that the subtype of the image can be png or jpeg. Similarly, the subtype of Video can be WEBM, MP4 etc.

	3. Content Type Encoding
	In this field, it is told which method has been used to convert mail information into ASCII or Binary number, such as 7-bit encoding, 8-bit encoding, etc.

	4. Content Id
	In this field, a unique "Content Id" number is appended to all email messages so that they can be uniquely identified.
	
	5. Content description
	This field contains a brief description of the content within the email. This means that information about whatever is being sent in the mail is clearly in the "Content Description". 
	This field also provides the information of name, creation date, and modification date of the file.


	advantages : vahi PGP ki limitations ko likh do sahi karke

LAYERS ->  PHYSICAL < DATA < NETWORK < TRANSPORT < APPLICATION
--------------------------------------------------->
UNIT 5 overview

IPSec (internet protocol security)
	on network layer 
	2 modes :
		transport mode : doesn't hide the IP address , encrypt the IP data 
		tunnel mode : hides org IP address and gives new IP address , hence whole packet is encrypted, uses VPNs.

		block diagram 

	2 protocols 
	AH (authentication header )
		authe + confi , but no privacy
		transport and tunnel mode ke block diagram ez
		ek AH data add hota hai

	ESP (encapsulating security payload)
		authe + confi + privacy
		transport and tunnel mode ke block diagram ez
		ek ESP header , ESP tail , ESP auth add hota hai

	IKE (internet key exchange)
		first phase 
		provide secure VPN for communicatuon
		works in tunnel mode 
		outcome is security association (SA)
		u know what is SA
--------------------------------------------------->
security Association , basically info hoti hai (idk) jisme pahle se hi we know ki hme konsa algo use karna hai , key size kya hai , lifetime kya hai ...etc ...etc 
	
	3 main parameters
		Security paramater index ( ye ek unique index hota h)
		Security protocol identifier (konsa hai ESP/AH ?)
		IP destination address
	others
		algo used 
		ESP/AH info , key lifetime etc
--------------------------------------------------->
security socket layer (SSL)
	lies between application and transport layer 
	security -> integrity + confidentiality + authentication

	4 protocols (pahle 2 imp)
	- Handshake protocol ( connection establishment  + authentication)
	- SSL record protocol ( integrity + confidentility)
	- alert protocol (alert message , error msgs while transmission etc)
	- change cipher spec protocol (1 bit ko change/flip karta hai , ye smj jo pending state -> running state )
--------------------------------------------------->
FIREWALLS
	a breach between external and internal internet.
	prevents unauthorised access 
	Monitors and contiols the incoming and outgoing traffic 
	can be software hardware or a mixture 

	TYPEs 
	- packet filtering (layer 4)
		checks IP header , TCP headers 
		works on network and transport layer 
		can block IP address , or even entire service
		sourceIP, destIP ,sourcePORT, destPORT

	- application level gateway (level 5)
		works on application layer 
		data ko bhi check karta hai 
		if there are malacious packets 
		more secure 
		processing overhead (diadvantage)

	- circuit level gateaway
		uses 2 TCP connection
			b/w internal host and gateaway
			b/w external host and gateaway
		surity check is done before connection establishment 
--------------------------------------------------->
INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM 
	pahle thodi thery likh dena , ke intruder kya hota hia, vo aaise kyo karta hia , hme detection systems kyo cahiye

	METHODS :
		signature based :
		- patterns/signature amorng packets 
		- we create databse of these pattern 
		- so agar match hua koi pattern to we know there is a intruder 
		- (disadvantage) koi naya pattern nahi recognise kar paega

		anomaly based :
		- abnormal behaviour
		- matlab ek student agar nsut ke data base se cherchar karega to obv shak hoga 
		- deviation from normal job/behaviour

	TYPEs :
		network based
		- basically network me intruders dudhta hai
		- matches traffic to the known attack
		- monitors , captures (screenshot) netword traffic and analysis it 
		- difficult to do in busy network

		host based  
		- installed on device /computers 
		- monitors packets from device only
		- alert if found 
		- file is removed or deleted
--------------------------------------------------->
NAT (network address translation)
	matlab vahi ki address ko translate kar dete hai , VPN vagera jo karte hai ,taaki access kar paye , ya apna address chupa paye 
	use a set of private address and global internet adddresses for ecternal commuications 
	use translation table to route msgs btw 2 networks
--------------------------------------------------->
A computer virus is a sort of malware that attaches itself to another program and can replicate and propagate once it has been installed on a userâ€™s computer
